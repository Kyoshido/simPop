Changes in synthPop version 0.1.4
  * starting to use new classes 'sampleObj', 'popObj' and 'synthPopObj' for the entire package

  * various fixes and improvements such as a new c++ implementation of calibVars()

  * cleanup dependencies in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE

  * remove method 'liblinear' from simCategorical() - has never really worked

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.3
  * parallelize simRelevation() on non-windows platforms

  * c++ algorithm for simulated annealing in calibPop()

  * multiple commits to fix documentation and cran-notes/warnings when checking

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.2
  * temporarily add explicit parallel-option to calibPop() for testing-purposes

  * more efficient implementation of auxiliary-function resample() used in calibPop()

  * changed default setting for auxiliary-variable 'factor' in calibPop() which now allows the algorithm to terminate in an accceptable time

  * added R/zzz.R to get current package version on loading the package

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.1
  * more efficient c++ implementation of iterative proportional updating

  * multiple imports from package simPopulation

  * reorganizations (simAnnealing -> synthPop,...)

Changes in synthPop version 0.1.0

  + code largely based on version 0.4.1 of simPopulation

  + use package parallel if possible for some functions (non-windows platforms)

  + first version of simulated annealing

  + first (very rough) version of IPU (iterative proportional updating)

  + remove vignette from simPopulation

  + update Citation

  + new methods for simCategorical (naivebayes, ctree and liblinear)
